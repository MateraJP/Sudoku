# Sudoku

This is my vision of a simple sudoku game.

I'm doing this to improve my skills, but if you have something to add please give it a push.

For now only the error settings is working fine, still needs to be improved (it is check on cells on double),
	the timer is fine and everything resets on the clean button.

For the next steps there is the Generator to work on and some skins to be ease on the eye.
